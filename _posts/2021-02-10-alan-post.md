# Welcome to my blog!
  Welcome to my post, my name is **Roberto Alan Cavazos**(you can just call me Alan.)and I am 21 years young. I am originally from Laredo, Texas which is about a 6 hour drive south from College Station. All of my life I lived in Mexico but due to violence and government unstability, I had to move to Texas when I was in middle school. I've played Tennis from as long as I can remember, when I was in High School, I had the chance to play at district level four years in a row. I am now a *Technology Management* student at **[Texas A&M](https://www.tamu.edu/) University**, I am currently looking for a summer 2021 technology internship. I hope to graduate in May of 2022 with a tech related job in Austin.
