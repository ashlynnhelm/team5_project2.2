Howdy!

My name is Hunter Thorsen and I am from New Caney, Texas which is just north of Houston.
I am a Senior Technology Management major with a business minor at Texas A&M.
If all goes according to plan, this Spring 2021 semester will be my last academic semester.
I plan on applying for a technology development program with AT&T for a hopeful internship this summer in order to get my degree in August.
